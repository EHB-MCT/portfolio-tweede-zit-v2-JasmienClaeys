# Contribution Guidelines

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from everyone and appreciate your interest in improving the project. To ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process, please follow these guidelines.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Bugs**: If you find a bug or issue with the project, please open an issue in our issue tracker. Be sure to include a clear description of the problem and steps to reproduce it.

2. **Request Features**: If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, please open a feature request issue. Describe the feature in detail and explain how it would benefit the project.

3. **Submit Code**: To submit code changes, please follow these steps:
   - **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
   - **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name for the branch (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-login-feature`). You can create and switch to a new branch with the following command:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

   - **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
   - **Commit Your Changes**: Once your changes are ready, commit them with a descriptive message. Use the following command to commit your changes:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat(): Add your message here."
     ```

   - **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository:

     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

   - **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `development` branch of the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any relevant issues.

## Code Style & Quality

To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Coding Standards**: Follow the existing code style used in the project. If the project uses a linter, ensure your code passes all linting checks.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known and widely accepted.
- **Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary. Provide JSDoc or similar comments for functions and classes to describe their purpose and usage.
- **Avoid Large Changes**: Try to keep your changes focused. If you're fixing a bug, avoid making unrelated changes. If you're adding a new feature, ensure that it doesn't break existing functionality.

## Testing

Ensuring that your code works correctly is crucial. Before submitting a pull request:

- **Write Tests**: If you are adding new functionality, include tests that verify the behavior of your code. Use the testing framework provided by the project, if applicable.
- **Run Existing Tests**: Run all existing tests to ensure that your changes do not introduce any regressions. If your changes cause any tests to fail, address these issues before submitting your pull request.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim to maintain or improve the test coverage of the project. New features should be accompanied by unit and/or integration tests.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues while using the project:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Before opening a new issue, please check if it has already been reported. This helps reduce duplicates and keeps the issue tracker clean.
2. **Open an Issue**: If the issue has not been reported, please open a GitHub issue. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem, the expected behavior, and any relevant error messages or logs.
3. **Labeling**: Use appropriate labels when creating the issue, such as "bug", "enhancement", "question", etc. This helps maintainers quickly identify the type of issue.
